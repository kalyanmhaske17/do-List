DoList is a simple and efficient to-do list web application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively.
The web page features an intuitive interface where users can add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks. 
When the "Start Organizing" button is clicked, a pop-up form appears, allowing users to submit their details, including Name, Email, and Phone Number. 
Upon submission, a confirmation pop-up displays a "Thank You" message, and the submitted data dynamically updates in a table at the bottom of the page. 
The application ensures responsiveness, follows the design outlined in the Figma file, and includes form validation for accurate data input.
